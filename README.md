# 🎓 Online Courses Analysis Dashboard


# 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing online course data for an EdTech startup aiming to expand its recorded lecture offerings. The objective is to uncover trends, viewer engagement patterns, and content optimization opportunities across categories, languages, and instructors.

The dashboard is built in Power BI to deliver interactive insights that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions about course offerings, instructor selection, and learner engagement.

# 🚀 Problem Statement

The startup collected data from multiple EdTech platforms but needed actionable insights to grow its recorded lecture services. The primary goal was to:

Identify trends in course distribution and viewer engagement

Highlight high-performing instructors, categories, and languages

Understand how factors like subtitles, duration, and skill diversity affect viewership

The analysis primarily emphasizes category-wise performance.

# 🎯 Key Objectives

Course Distribution – Analyze number of courses by type, category, and subcategory.

Engagement Patterns – Calculate average views for each category, subcategory, and language.

Top Skills – Identify in-demand skills by category.

Language Insights – Examine course and viewer language distribution.

Top 5 Categories – Determine language preferences of viewers.

Subtitles Impact – Study how subtitle availability affects viewership.

Top Instructors – Identify top 3 instructors per category/subcategory based on ratings.

Duration vs Views – Evaluate how course duration influences engagement.

Skill Variety Impact – Analyze whether broader skill coverage increases views.

# 🧩 Tools & Technologies

Power BI – For data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation

Excel / CSV – For initial data exploration and cleaning

DAX – For calculated measures and insights generation

# 🧑‍🏫 Instructor & Skill Analysis

Top Instructors by Rating: Static table listing the highest-rated instructors per category.

Skills & Duration Matrix: Table comparing average skills offered and average duration (hours) per category.

# 📈 Key Insights

English dominates both course creation and viewership, but multilingual offerings (Spanish, French, Portuguese) present growth opportunities.

Data Science and Information Technology lead in viewership and engagement.

Courses with more subtitles and optimal duration (~60–120 hrs) attract significantly higher views.

Categories with broader skill diversity tend to have higher average views.

Top instructors (e.g., Microsoft, University of Illinois, Aarti Bagul) consistently maintain strong ratings across multiple categories.

# 🧮 DAX & Data Modeling

Custom DAX measures were created to calculate:

Average Views by Category / Subcategory / Language

Rank by Average Views

Duration conversion (monthly = 60 hrs, flexible = 200 hrs)

Instructor performance metrics
